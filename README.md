## Installation
When you download the .zip from the releases tab, you then open steam, go to Muck, click on the little settings wheel, and hit "Manage", and then "Browse Local Files". It should open File Explorer with files such as "Muck.exe" and "Muck_Data". Simply extract the contents of the zip into the folder, and start Muck with steam. You can check if Mitch has loaded by going to the "About" page, and it should state that you are using Mitch Client.
