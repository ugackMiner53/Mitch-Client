## Installation
Download the .exe from the [releases](https://github.com/ugackMiner53/Mitch-Client/releases) tab, then run it. If it shows a windows smartscreen warning, hit "More Info" and then hit "Run Anyway". Then, it should ask for administrator privilages. Hit "Yes", and then click "Next" and "Install".

If the above method doesn't work for you, then download the .zip from the [releases](https://github.com/ugackMiner53/Mitch-Client/releases) tab, open steam, go to Muck, click on the little settings wheel, and hit "Manage", and then "Browse Local Files". It should open File Explorer with files such as "Muck.exe" and "Muck_Data". Simply extract the contents of the zip into the folder, and start Muck with steam. You can check if Mitch has loaded by going to the "About" page, and it should state that you are using Mitch Client.

If neither of these steps do not work for you, please create an issue
